# TODO — deferred ideas

Where the work stands: `docs/STATE.md` (injected into every session
through `instructions` in `opencode.json`; refresh it with `/handoff`).
This file is the open list only: finished work lives in `CHANGELOG.md`
and git, and hard-won QML/toolkit rules in `docs/QML-NOTES.md`.

## Recurring

- Re-audit the environment presets against vendor docs on every release
  tag (Mesa/NVIDIA semantics drift; verify `vblank_mode` /
  `__GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK` values). Last: 2026-10-19 — the vsync pair
  stands against Mesa's current driconf registry (plus the xmlconfig
  env-override test) and the 580.x NVIDIA README; both are
  OpenGL/GLX-only, so Vulkan needs its own present mode and the presets
  carry that in their `note`.

## Deferred research

- [ ] Playnite plugin metadata (Steam/Epic/GOG/PCGW/VNDB) for the local
  library import of Lutris/Playnite/Faugus file formats. The import
  itself shipped; this is the metadata enrichment on top of it.
- [ ] Online sources à la Playnite for categories/tags (the per-game
  categories and the drawer filter shipped without them).
